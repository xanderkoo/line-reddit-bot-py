LINE Bot for Reddit Posts

Simple app to get a specified number of posts from a specified subreddit by sending a message to the LINE bot, e.g. "r/pics 10".

Uses the LINE Messaging API, Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW), with the webhook endpoint hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

Unfortunately the project has hit a wall because I've hit my monthly limit of 1000 (or maybe 500?) broadcast messages from the free plan on the LINE Messaging API. Maybe it'll work if I make it all of the images reply messages (i.e. one post at a time).
